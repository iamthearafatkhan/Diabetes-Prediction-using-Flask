# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Flask
A web-based application for predicting the likelihood of diabetes using a trained ANN model. Built with Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend, this project takes user inputs to predict whether the individual is diabetic. The model was trained using a balanced dataset with SMOTE and includes a scaler for preprocessing inputs.
