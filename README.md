# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Flask
A web-based application for predicting the likelihood of diabetes using a trained ANN model. Built with Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend, this project takes user inputs to predict whether the individual is diabetic. The model was trained using a balanced dataset with SMOTE and includes a scaler for preprocessing inputs.
üîç Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-based web application built using Flask that predicts diabetes in individuals based on health and lifestyle factors. It uses a trained deep learning model (ANN) developed with TensorFlow/Keras.
